# Misnomer

It's been said that naming is one of the hardest things in computer science. Misnomer is an Xcode 8+ extension that helps you find names for code you highlight.

## How it works:
Highlight a variable name and run the Misnomer extension. Your variable name will be replaced with a synonym.
